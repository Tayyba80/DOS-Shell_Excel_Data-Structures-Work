# Third Semester

My third semester projects.

1. Excel Sheet

## Excel Sheet

In this project I used linked list with 4 pointers left,right,up,down to manage the connection of every box in the excel sheet. This data structure is called quard linklist. Associated operations of the linklist include adding columns, removing columns and whatnot.
